# Stetson's appilcation to Astro Technology Company

üëç  Thank you for taking the time to consider me

I decided to create something with Astro to apply.  I'm glad that I did because I think what you're doing is great!  I am familiar with 11ty and love the way that data can be used in frontmatter or as a json file.  I disliked 11ty because I had to template with nunjucks and had to bring my own build tool.

I can pass data around in Astro just like I've done in 11ty, and you've got Vite!  It's great.

## What I'm doing now
---

I have 2 jobs currently

[Great Plains Painting](https://greatplainspaintingkc.com/)<br>
*I started this company in 2015 and sold it in 2019 so that my girlfiend and I could move closer to her family in CA.  I still help with technology related things and high level business functions*

[Tis the Season Holiday Lighting](https://tistheseasonkc.com/)<br>
*I started this company with a partner in 2016.  We operate seasonally (only around Christmas for a few months).  I do all the technology related functions and in the field installing of the holiday lights with my team*

## Why I'd like to work for Astro
---

I'd like to move away from all functions for Great Plains Painting and on to something 100% technology focused.  I've come along way teaching myself how to code, but I could move faster if my work is focused on it and I worked with people I could get support from.

# This Site üßë‚Äçüíª

I kept things about the same, but did add a little Svelte Component for the project pages -- [QuickDeets.Svelte](https://github.com/StetsonRamey/astro-app/blob/master/src/components/QuickDeets.svelte).

As I'd done in 11ty I made a little json file to hold some data and pulled that in to populate some items in the component along with the markdown frontmatter.

I didn't feel like updating the About page in HTML, so I made a layout and slotted in a .md file where I wrote the About Me content.

Your docs are great and clearly explained how to get going and your starter examples are wonderful to setup and work with!  Spinning up this little site was fun and straightforward.
