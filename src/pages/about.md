## Introduction

I'm a largely self taught developer who is still very much learning the craft of web/software development, though I get the sense that the learning never really ends.  I started my first company in my 20s, and though I have always been interested in web development, the need to seriously learn it happened then.  It was clear to me that knowing how to program a computer to automate repetitive tasks and build fast websites that google liked to rank would give me near infinite leverage in what I could do with a small business.

And it has.  As an example - we run our holiday lighting company - [Tis the Season](/project/tis-the-season) - with 1.5 office people (me half time and our office manager full time).  We have over 650 customers annually, and grow by about 200 each year.  We started with paper organization, a Google Sheet CRM, and did everything manually.  Texting updates was manual, one person at a time, as was invoice creation.  Today, Angela (our office manager) clicks one button to generate 600+ invoices and it happens in less than 30 seconds.  It used to take her a full day to create the invoices one at a time.

I love working with computers and code because:

1. Computers don't forget to send a message or run a task
2. Given the same inputs, I can count on the same thing to happen time and again
3. At certain tasks, they're orders of magnitude faster than we can be -- build a tool once and get paid in time whenever I use it

## Why I'm Applying to Work with Astro Technology Company

I'd like to take my skills to another level.  Currently I write a little code for the company I sold - [Great Plains Painting](/projects/great-plains-painting) - but mostly perform business functions (accounting, insurance, etc...) remotely with my old team in Kansas City.  I write more code for our holiday lighting business, but not everyday.  Great Plains Painting can function without me, and I'd like to replace my time spent on that with working for a small group of people where I can both practice everyday and have the support of experts.

## Why I Might be a Good Fit

I excel at:
- figuring things out
- solving problems
- working in a remote environment
- being part of a high performing team

I understand the value and need for good people to work with.  Because I've run a couple of small businesses I've done a little bit of everything - sales, marketing, accounting, hiring, training, managing and whatever else I've needed to do.  I believe I can contribute to your team as well.
