  A personal website I built to get familiar with 11ty and TailwindCSS.  I borrowed bits from things I liked.  There's no JS on the page, and I tried to keep things as fast as I could.
site: https://www.how2javascript.com
stack:
  The site is built with straight 11ty, Nunjucks for Templating, and TailwindCSS for styling.
purpose:
    I wanted to figure out 11ty because I wanted to rebuild our Tis the Season site with it to take advantage of templating.  And everyone was talking about TailwindCSS so I thought I'd try that out as well.
backend:
    No backend on this one
tags:
  - 11ty SSG
  - TailwindCSS

This is the first real site I made with 11ty.  I have no shame in admitting, I spent lots of time working through tutorials on React and Svelte.  But at the end of the day, for the sites I needed to build, those tools seemed like extreme overkill.  11ty is a much better fit for a site with all static content and a contact form with a tiny bit of light javascript.  I looked for a tool to learn to build our business websites with, and 11ty seemed best aligned with my needs so I decided to build this to learn it.  I am bummed that the templating seems to antiquated.  After reading through 11ty's docs I went for Nunjucks mostly as it seemed best supported and easiest to understand.  But it sure would be nice to use Svelte or React for templating in 11ty (which is essentially why Astro is so cool and what Ben Holmes is doing with Slinkity).

I designed the site and though I don't love the colors, I am happy with the way it turned out.  I love the way 11ty works (compared to my previous experience with raw html and sass).  Templating is a game changer!  Messing around with tags was probably the most fun part of building this site.  And actually putting together the [style guide](https://www.how2javascript.com/web/style-guide/) page modeled on [Zac Leatherman's](https://www.zachleat.com/web/style-guide/) showed me a bunch of interesting CSS tricks.

### What I'd do differently

This one I'm pretty happy with.  If I were to begin writing on this blog, I'd hire a designer to give me a proper color palette.
